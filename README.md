# Prework - *IntroIngrid*

Submitted by: **Ingrid Betancourt**

**IntroIngrid** is an app that changes the background color the app with a button. I updated the UI of the app with different fonts and added image views to make it more appealing. [TODO] 

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps:
- Spotify 
    One of my favorite things is the way the background color matches the color scheme of the album/song/playlist the user is looking at. I feel like this adds more personalization and makes creating playlist more fun.
    Another part of the UI is the simplistic navigation bar. 
    
- Pinterest
    The home page that users see with a pins that relate to the users recent searches is what makes this app feel more personalized
    Another feature that is notable is the ability to create a collection of your favorite pins
    
-Royal Match
    The background change plays a big role in the feel of the game
    Limited UI Elements prevents the game from feeling to overwhelming


 Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
 
 I would like to create an app for Mexican Recipes. Similar to the app Tasty, I want there to be an app that houses all these well known recipes. Users could look up recipes and have options of recipes that are to their preference. The recipes that users want to try can be saved and added to a sort of recipe book that they can contruct to their liking. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
